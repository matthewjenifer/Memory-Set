<h2>What's SET?</h2>

<p>The game of SET was invented by population geneticist Marsha Jean Falco in 1974.

She was studying epilepsy in German Shepherds and began representing genetic data on the dogs by drawing symbols on cards and then searching for patterns in the data.

After realizing the potential as a challenging puzzle, with encouragement from friends and family she developed and marketed the card game.

Since then, SET has become a huge hit both inside and outside the mathematical community. 

When I first discovered the game a few years ago I never forgot it, so it seemed like a worthy try for my first web-game project.</p>

<h2>My Approach</h2>

<p>I began with the user interface. I designed the homepage to have a dedicated playing area with cards aligned in 3 rows of four. 

After dividing the page into 3 sections, I began designing the cards I knew I would need in canva. After that I wrote the code for each card to flip like your standard 2 image memory game. 

Then I moved to the rules page, and re-used the game area as a display space for the rules, and the side panel for a brief bio of the original game's creator.

Next I added a 60 second timer and a way to log the users attempt. </p>

<h4>How to Win the Game</h4>

<p>Upon loading the game page a 60 second countdown begins. Your task is to find all four possible SETS before the clock stops you..easy enough...if your MEMORY is sharp that is... </p>
